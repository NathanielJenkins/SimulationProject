# SimulationProject
CSC 446 Simulation final Project

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project investigates how the inclusion of a priority queue in an intermediary router helps to mitigate the packet reordering problem.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Read the report to understand the findings. If you want to run the simulation yourself, download all java files in the repository and run PacketSimulation.java</p>
<p>The queues can be changing the router type, however, all router types have been simulated as part of the project report</p>
